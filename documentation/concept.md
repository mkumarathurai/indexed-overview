## Concept

"Indexed Overview" is designed as a central hub for business intelligence, consolidating data from various sources (internal tracking and external APIs like Jira, Tempo, HubSpot) into a unified dashboard and dedicated modules. Its core strength lies in its modular architecture, where each functional area (Projects, Budget, Time Tracking, Deals) is developed as a self-contained unit within the app/Modules directory. This promotes separation of concerns, easier maintenance, testing, and scalability.
